# Luna
Luna is a framework for Lua built on top of Love2D which acts as a Lua version of the Unity game engine

i'm coding this purely from my Lua knowledge and don't have the hardware to actually test this, so let me know if anything doesn't work!

Plans:
* Documentation
* Refine README
* *Much* More Content
